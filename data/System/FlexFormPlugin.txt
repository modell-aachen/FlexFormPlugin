%TOC%

This plugin leverages the internal capabilities to render an interface for %SYSTEMWEB%.DataForms.
This API is part of the =Form= class of Foswiki and is called =renderForEdit()=. It takes
a form definition and creates an appropriate edit interface for the given !DataFrom. This
feature is actually very handy to write custom EDIT_TEMPLATEs and VIEW_TEMPLATEs in wiki applications.

The %<nop>RENDEFFOREDIT and %<nop>RENDERFORDISPLAY macros allows wiki application authors
to customize interfaces to !DataForms while not losing the flexibility of defining a !DataForm
in one place.

Imagine you created an EDIT_TEMPLATE _without_ %<nop>RENDERFOREDIT
by creating an HTML input form manually. When you decide to extend or modify a form definition later
you will always have to maintain these HTML forms in an EDIT_TEMPLATE as well. This redundancy can
be avoided by using a %<nop>RENDERFOREDIT macro that loops over all formfields in your !DataForm
to render the input form in a more dynamic way while still customizing the overall output.

In addition, !FlexFormPlugin facilitates the extraction of field default values (such as valid schema options) from 
!DataForm. See http://foswiki.org/Development/MacroForRetrievingFieldDefaultValues for background.

---++ Usage
---+++ RENDERFOREDIT
| *Parameter* | *Description* | *Default* |
| "..." (or topic="..." | name of a topic to render the edit form for | the base topic of the current url |
| excludeattr="..." | regular expression field attributes must match to be excluded from the output | undefined |
| exclude="..." | regular expression fieldnames must match to be excluded from the output | undefined |
| fields="&lt;fieldname1>, &lt;fieldname2>, ..." | list of formfields to render the interface for | all known formfields |
| footer="..." | footer string to apped to the output | &lt;empty string> |
| format="..." | format string to render each formfield with, more info below | =$edit$mandatory= |
| form="..." | topic name containing the !DataForm definition | form found at the base topic |
| header="..." | header string to be put in front of the output | &lt;empty string> |
| hidden="..." | those fields that match this regular expression will be rendered hidden | undefined |
| includeattr="..." | regular expression field attributes must match to be included in the output | undefined |
| include="..." | regular expression fieldnames must match to be included in the output | undefined |
| mandatory="..." | string to be inserted when a field is mandatory | <span class='foswikiAlert'>**</span> |
| map="&lt;fieldname1>=&lt;title1>, &lt;fieldname2>=&lt;title2>, ..." | allows to map a fieldname to a different title string in the edit interface (*deprecated*: please use &lt;fieldname>_title to redefine the title) | original fieldnames are used as title string |
| separator="..." | string to be put between each formatted output per formfield | &lt;empty string> |
| sort="on/off" | sort values of multi-valued formfields | on |
| value="..." | value to be inserted into the edit interface; makes sense for single-field calls only | stored value in the base topic |
| &lt;fieldname>_attributes="..." %BR% \
  &lt;fieldname>_default="..." %BR% \
  &lt;fieldname>_description="..." %BR% \
  &lt;fieldname>_format="..." %BR% \
  &lt;fieldname>_size="..." %BR% \
  &lt;fieldname>_title="..." %BR% \
  &lt;fieldname>_type="..." %BR% \
  &lt;fieldname>_values="..." %BR% \
  | these parameters allow to override the formfield properties as specified in the !DataForm definition; for example a =Teaser_type="text"= , =Teaser_size="30"= will override a definition of a =Teaser= formfield that otherwise is a =textarea= of size =80x25=; &lt;fieldname>_values redefines the list of allowed values for that field | values as defined in the !DataForm definition and the current topic |
| &lt;fieldname>_value="..." | value to be inserted into the edit interface of the named field | looks for urlparam &lt;fieldname>, defaults to stored value |
| &lt;fieldname>_sort="..." | on/off/asc/desc/rev - sort allowed values before displaying them | as defined in the !DataForm |

---+++ RENDERFORDISPLAY
| *Parameter* | *Description* | *Default* |
| "..." or topic="..." | name of a topic to display the form for | the base topic of the current url |
| autolink="on/off" | enable/disable !WikiWord autolinking when rendering a formfield; setting =autolink= sets the default for all fields specific settings of =&lt;fieldname>_autolink=which can, that is you can disable autolinking globally and switch it back on per field | on |
| excludeattr="..." | regular expression field attributes must match to be excluded from the output | undefined |
| exclude="..." | regular expression fieldnames must match to be excluded from the output | undefined |
| fields="&lt;fieldname1>, &lt;fieldname2>, ..." | list of formfields to be displayed | all known formfields |
| footer="..." | footer string to apped to the output | &lt;empty string> |
| format="..." | format string to render each formfield with, more info below | =$edit$mandatory= |
| form="..." | topic name containing the !DataForm definition | form found at the base topic |
| header="..." | header string to be put in front of the output | &lt;empty string> |
| hideempty="on/off" | hide empty formfields | off |
| includeattr="..." | regular expression field attributes must match to be included in the output | undefined |
| include="..." | regular expression fieldnames must match to be included in the output | undefined |
| labelformat="..." | format string used for labels exclusively; labels aren't real input fields; they are part of the form definition but carry read-only values only if at all  | same as =format= |
| map="&lt;fieldname1>=&lt;title1>, &lt;fieldname2>=&lt;title2>, ..." | allows to map a fieldname to a different title string (*deprecated*: please use &lt;fieldname>_title to redefine the title) | original fieldnames are used as title string |
| separator="..." | string to be put between each formatted output per formfield | &lt;empty string> |
| sort="on/off" | sort values of multi-valued formfields | on |
| valueseparator="..." | string to be put between each allowed value as defined in the form schema | , |
| &lt;fieldname>_attributes="..." %BR% \
  &lt;fieldname>_autolink="..." %BR% \
  &lt;fieldname>_default="..." %BR% \
  &lt;fieldname>_description="..." %BR% \
  &lt;fieldname>_format="..." %BR% \
  &lt;fieldname>_size="..." %BR% \
  &lt;fieldname>_sort="..." %BR% \
  &lt;fieldname>_title="..." %BR% \
  &lt;fieldname>_type="..." %BR% \
  &lt;fieldname>_value="..." %BR% \
  &lt;fieldname>_values="..." %BR% \
  | see above | defaults as defined in the !DataForm definition and the current topic |

If all three =format=, =header= and =footer= are undefined a =foswikiFormSteps= block will be rendered as illustrated in the example below.

The =format= parameter may contain the following pseudo-variables:
   * =$attrs=: attribute string as given in the !DataForm definition
   * =$description=: formfield description in !DataForm 
   * =$edit=: the HTML form element as specified by the !DataForm definition, that is a input field, a textarea, a select box, whatever
   * =$extra=: the "extra" return value of the =Foswiki::Form::renderForEdit()= call
   * =$mandatory=: placeholder to display the =mandatory= flag when a formfield is mandatory; the format of the mandatroy flag can be defined in the =mandatory= parameter to RENDERFOREDIT
   * =$name=: the original fieldname
   * =$size=: size parameter of the formfield as given in the !DataForm definition
   * =$title=: the fieldtitle derived from the fieldname and remapped as specified in the =map= parameter
   * =$tooltip=: formfield description in !DataForm (*deprecated*: use =$description= instead)
   * =$type=: type of formfield as given in the !DataForm definition
   * =$value=: current value of the formfield; for =+value= formfields this is the _mapped_ value use =$origvalue= to get the original one
   * =$origvalue=: current value of the formfield; for =+value= formfields this is the original _unmapped_ value of the formfield
   * =$values=: list of all allowed values for the formfield as defined in the !DataForm definition
   * =$default=: this is the default value if no value is specified in the topic itself

---++ Examples

<verbatim>
%RENDERFOREDIT{
  form="%USERSWEB%.UserForm"
  exclude="Email|Comment|State"
  FirstName_value="Horst"
  LastName_value="Buchholz"
  map="VoIP=Skype"
}%
</verbatim>

%RENDERFOREDIT{
  form="%USERSWEB%.UserForm"
  exclude="Email|Comment|State"
  FirstName_value="Horst"
  LastName_value="Buchholz"
  map="VoIP=Skype"
}%

---+++ Display the allowed values of one field and its default

<verbatim>
%RENDERFORDISPLAY{
  form="ValueTransactionForm" 
  field="FromRole"
